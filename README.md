This is a music player app similar to Apple Music or VLC and is my first personal project for my Boot.dev course. This app is built on the tkinter and VLC libraries.

# Notes

Music files are **not stored in the repository**.  
Place your music files inside:

```
Music/Songs/
Music/Albums/
```

The project uses `.gitkeep` files so these directories exist even when empty.

* Updates to controls, hotkeys, and right clicks
* Move top control banner to tkinter grid for cleaner look
* Add artwork Display
* Update UI with CustomTkinter
* Create popup play queue and history display
* Implement a play counts column
* Ability to write meta-data to song files

* Recently Played Playlist
